# CLASS NOTES

HTML, CSS and JavaScript are the core languages of the web - forming the backbone of all websites and web content.CSS controls how a page looks, JavaScript controls how a page behaves, and HTML provides the essential structure and content of a web page.


HTML is a markup language. It’s not a programming language because it doesn’t understand logic. HTML contains information about the structure, content and display of a document.

# HTML Tags
HTML is made up of tags. Tags are used to mark up the content and give the browser information about how to display the text. Tags are simply short pieces of text starting with the less-than sign (<) and ending with the greater-than sign (>). Tags are used to mark up the start and end of an HTML element.

{% highlight ruby %}
<p></p>
{% endhighlight %}

# HTML elements
An element represents some kind of structure or semantics and generally consists of a start tag, content, and an end tag. This is a paragraph element:

{% highlight ruby %}
<p>This is the content of the paragraph element.</p>
{% endhighlight %}

#HTML attributes
Some tags also have attributes associated with them, attributes define a property for an element. They appear in the start tag.

{% highlight ruby %}
<p lang='en'>This is the content of the paragraph element.</p>
{% endhighlight %}


# The Skeletal System
There are a few main tags that every web page must have - html, head, title, and body. The very simplest web page looks like this in text view:

{% highlight ruby %}
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
 <head>
	<title>The name of my page</title>
 </head>

 <body>
  <p>Some information here.</p>
 </body>
</html>
{% endhighlight %}

# Links
One of the most improtant tags, the `<a>` tag, defines a hyperlink, which is used to link from one page to another. The most important attribute of the `<a>` element is the href attribute, which indicates the link's destination.

{% highlight ruby %}
<a href="http://www.w3schools.com">Visit W3Schools.com!</a>
{% endhighlight %}

The a tag requires an attribute of ‘href’, which is short for hyperlink reference — this is where you put the URL of the link. You can link to a page on your own site or to an external page.

# More Tags
Some of the tags we talked about in class: `<p>`, `<h1>` to `<h6>`, `<img>`, `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`, `<strong>`, `<em>`, `<u>`

For a complete list of all HTML tags, see the [w3school's HTML Element Reference](http://www.w3schools.com/tags/).

# ASSIGNMENT #1: 'Hello World'
+ Create a basic one page html document that displays "hello world" and uses at least **12 different kinds of tags**. You may re-use tags as many times as you want, but you must use at least 12 unique tags within your page. Save your page as hello-world.html.

+ Download a code editor (I recommend Sublime Text 2), an FTP client, and the CU VPN client. Follow [these instructions](http://creative.colorado.edu/~schaal/web/pdf/creative-server-instructions.pdf) for connecting to the Creative Server. 

+ Upload your hello-world.html page to your web directory (web folder inside the public_html directory) on the creative server.

+ The purpose of the project is to get you comfortable writing HTML tags, and to get your off-campus work/coding environment setup.

**Assignment #1 is due before class on 1/20.**

# READING
Read [As We May Think, by Vannevar Bush](http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/) and read [Long Live the Web, by Tim Berners-Lee](http://ariellehein.com/readings/Berners-Lee-Long-Live-The-Web.pdf).

Both readings should be completed prior to class on 1/20. Be prepared to discuss the reading in class that day.
