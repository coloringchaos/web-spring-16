**CSS** - controls how a page looks<br>
**JAVASCRIPT** - controls how a page behaves<br>
**HTML** - provides the essential structure and content of a web page


HTML is a markup language. It’s not a programming language because it doesn’t understand logic; it simply contains information about the structure and display of a document. HTML contains information about the structure, content and display of a document.

# HTML Tags

HTML is made up of tags. Tags give information about the content and display of text. Tags are simply little pieces of text starting with the less-than sign (<) and ending with the greater-than sign (>). Tags are used to mark up the start and end of an HTML element.

{% highlight ruby %}
<p></p>
{% endhighlight %}

# HTML elements
An element represents some kind of structure or semantics and generally consists of a start tag, content, and an end tag. This is a paragraph element:

{% highlight ruby %}
<p>This is the content of the paragraph element.</p>
{% endhighlight %}

#HTML attributes
Some tags also have attributes associated with them, attributes define a property for an element. They appear in the start tag.

{% highlight ruby %}
<p lang='en'>This is the content of the paragraph element.</p>
{% endhighlight %}


# The Skeletal System
There are a few main tags that every web page must have - html, head, title, and body. The very simplest web page looks like this in text view:

{% highlight ruby %}
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
 <head>
	<title>The name of my page</title>
 </head>

 <body>
  <p>Some information here.</p>
 </body>
</html>
{% endhighlight %}
