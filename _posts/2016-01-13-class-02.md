# ASSIGNMENT #1: 'Hello World'
+ Create a basic one page html document that displays "hello world" and uses at least **12 different kinds of tags**. You may re-use tags as many times as you want, but you must use at least 12 unique tags within your page. Save your page as hello-world.html.

+ Download a code editor (I recommend Sublime Text 2), an FTP client, and the CU VPN client. Follow [these instructions](http://creative.colorado.edu/~schaal/web/pdf/creative-server-instructions.pdf) for connecting to the Creative Server. 

+ Upload your hello-world.html page to your web directory (web folder inside the public_html directory) on the creative server.

+ The purpose of the project is to get you comfortable writing HTML tags, and to get your off-campus work/coding environment setup.

**Assignment #1 is due before class on 1/20.**
