# CLASS NOTES
<!-- [HTML5 Notes](http://creative.colorado.edu/~schaal/web/pdf/web-html5.pdf) -->

Every page and every image on a website has a ***URL*** (or Uniform Resource Locator). <br>The URL is made up of the **domain name** such as `creative.colorado.edu` followed by the **path** to that page or image, like `/~identikey/my-page.html`. The complete URL would look like: `creative.colorado.edu/~identikey/my-page.html`

<!-- ![url]({{ site.url }}/img/url.png) -->

# Site Structure & Navigation
+ Every page and every image on a website has a URL
+ Every website is built inside directories on a web server
+ Each web page is a separate file on that web server (ending in .html or .js)
+ Sometimes when you go to a URL, there is no file listed in the URL 
+ For example, we type: `colorado.edu` instead of `colorado.edu/index.html`

#index.html
This is default HTML file that appears in a browser when a user invokes a URL, it is the main homepage of a site. Every directory should have an index.html page for usability and security purposes.

#Writing Links
Links are created using the `<a>` element; users can click on anything between the opening `<a>` tag and the closing `</a>` tag. You specify which page you want to link to using the `href=""` attribute.

#Absolute Links
A hyperlink containing a full URL, which includes all the information needed to find a particular site, page or document or other addressable item on the Internet. This information includes the protocol to use, such as HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) or FTP (File Transfer Protocol).

{% highlight html %}
<a href="http://www.colorado.edu/">Colorado.edu</a>
{% endhighlight %}

#Relative Links
Used when linking to pages within your own website. they provide a shorthand way of telling the browser where to find your files. If you are linking to a page within your own site, it is best to use relative links rather than absolute links or qualified URLS.

{% highlight html %}
<a href="music/listings.html">Listings</a>
{% endhighlight %}

To move **IN** a directory, use a backslash `/` notation, the directory name and the file name:
{% highlight html %}
movies/cinema/listings.html
{% endhighlight %}

To move OUT a directory, use the following notation:  `../`
{% highlight html %}
../../index.html
{% endhighlight %}

#Google Web Fonts
Visit [google.com/fonts](https://www.google.com/fonts) and choose a font to use, then click the middle button (the quick use option). Follow their directions:

1. Choose the style you want
2. Choose the character set you want (you can usually skip this)
3. Add the link code inside the head tags of your html page
4. Integrate your css - either on an external stylesheet or within a style tag within the html code

On your .html page, you will have something like this in the `<head>` tag:
{% highlight html %}
<link href='https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans' rel='stylesheet' type='text/css'>
{% endhighlight %}

And you will add the css within a `<style>` tag on the html page or on an external .css stylesheet:
{% highlight html %}
<style>
	body {
		font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;
	}
</style>
{% endhighlight %}

#Font Awesome Icons
Paste the following code into the `<head>` section of your site's HTML. This link can also be found on the [Get Started Page](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/get-started/) on Font Awesome.
{% highlight html %}
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/font-awesome/4.5.0/css/font-awesome.min.css">
{% endhighlight %}

Then, choose what icon you want to use and just copy and paste the code in your html. It will look something like this:
{% highlight html %}
<i class="fa fa-fort-awesome"></i>
{% endhighlight %}

# Assignment 2: Assignment Portal

Create a one page index.html website which will be used to link to all of your work throughout the semester. Each time a new homework assignment or project is due, you will upload it to the Creative server and then create a hyperlink to that page on you Assignment Portal. You also must submit each assignment on Edmodo.

Name your .html file “index.html” and upload it directly into your public_html directory on your server space.

Your assignment portal URL will look like this: ***http://creative.colorado.edu/~identikey***

You are required to use this assignment portal to link to all of your work throughout the semester. If assignments and projects are not linked to your assignment portal, they will not be accepted for credit. If you end up changing your assignment portal address at some point during the semester, you must email me and let me know.

**Assignment 2 is due before class on 1/27**
