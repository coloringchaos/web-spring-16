# Assignment 2: Assignment Portal

Create a one page .html-based website which will be used to turn in all of your work throughout the semester. Each time a new homework assignment or project is due, you will upload it online and then create a hyperlink to that assignment or project on you Assignment Portal.

Your now, your Assignment Portal will be fairly minimal but will be added to a redesigned throughout the semester. Name your .html file “index.html” and upload it to your server space into a new directory called “web”

Your assignment portal URL will look something like this: ***http://creative.colorado.edu/~userName/web***

You are required to use this assignment portal to link to all of your work throughout the semester. If assignments and projects are not linked to your assignment portal, they will not be accepted for credit. If you end up changing your assignment portal address at some point during the semester, you must email me and let me know.
