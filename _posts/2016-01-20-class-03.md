# Project 1: Hypertext Narrative
Hypertext fiction is a genre of electronic literature, characterized by the use of hypertext links which provide a new context for non-linearity in literature and reader interaction

Choose a popular childrenâ€™s story, and without altering the text, redesign it as a non-linear narrative. Divide the story in multiple parts and place each part into a html page. Each page should have at 2-3 links to other segments. Infinite or Ending?

Parameters

html5 structure
save the starting page as "hypertext-01.html"
figure "title card" using placehold.it
google fonts
font awesome icons
validate each page at validator.w3.org
upload the pages to the web directory of the creative server

**Project 1 is due before class on 1/27**
