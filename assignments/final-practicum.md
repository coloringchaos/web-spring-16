# Practicum Instructions 

For this WEB practicum, you must create a web page based on the provided photoshop composition. You will be evaluated on the completeness of your site, and how accurately you translated photoshop the design. 

You may use Google, your notes and any other example code as a reference for this practicum. You may NOT get help (via email, text, etc) from any other person. 

Follow these instructions to get started:

1. Download [this]() file which includes 1) a .psd composition, 2) an assets folder, and 3) a html skeleton to work from. 

2. Once you download the .zip, double click on it to unpack it. 

3. **Then, rename the 'practicum-site' folder to include your name, like this: 'practicum-MyName'.** For example, I would rename my folder 'practicum-ArielleHein'.

# How to turn this in:

When you are finished, follow these instructions to submit your work:

1. Upload the site you made to your CU creative server

2. Right click on the folder 'practicum-MyName' and choose ***Compress "practicum-MyName"*** - this will generate a .zip file. After you make this zip, I highly suggest checking it by double clicking to confirm that it has all of your files inside! If you submit an empty zip you will not get credit.

3. Log into Edmodo and find the assignment for 'Final Practicum'

3. Submit the .zip file AND the url to your site on the server

***YOU MUST SUBMIT BOTH THE ZIP OF YOUR RAW FILES AND THE URL TO GET FULL CREDIT*** <br>If you do not submit BOTH a url and .zip with your files, you will be automatically deducted 30%

# General suggestions:

+ Get all content into the html FIRST, after that begin styling the css. 
+ Move on if you get stuck on something and come back to it later.
+ Save enough time to upload and submit your .zip and url to Edmodo!
