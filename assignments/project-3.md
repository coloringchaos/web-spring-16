Create an interactive, web-based conceptual self-portrait.

This project is *not* intended to be a portfolio, instead it is an opportunity to represent yourself creatively on the web. Consider how the Internet can be used as a creative medium, and the ways in which web content is distinctive from traditional medias. Your challenge is to create a project that wants to live on the web, and cannot be experienced in any other way.

You have a lot of freedom in this project to come up with something unique and original. You are highly encouraged to use multiple kinds of media (video, graphics, drawings, sound, photos, etc.).
