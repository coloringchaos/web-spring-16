title: Responsive Narrative
permalink: /project-4/
---

Create a single ***responsive*** web page that tells a "multiple page" story by using @media queries to display and hide content based on the width of a browser window. Each individual "frame" should tell a part of the narrative. 
<!-- The background image should cycle through a stop motion or flipbook style animation.  -->

You must also use javascript events to add interactivity to the project. You might hide and show hidden messages, change the color or content of something, or create animated effects.

The content can be a creative short story, topic, or idea of your own. All graphics and imagery must be original.

[This](http://creative.colorado.edu/~aljo7103/web/responsive-story.html) project from a previous semester of Web is a great example / reference for your project.
