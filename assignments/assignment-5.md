# External CSS

Choose an existing .html page that you have already created (hello world, your index, image gallery...) and design a css style for that page. 

1. Draw a rough wireframe sketch of the design you intend to implement. 

2. Implement your design using an external .css stylesheet that your .html page is linked to. 

Post this exercise to your assignment portal as a **new link** indicating that the page has a new external stylesheet attached. Submit your wireframe sketch the url of your page on Edmodo.
