# p5 Primatives

Using p5js, create a simple sketch that uses only 2D primitive shapes – `arc()`, `curve()`, `ellipse()`, `line()`, `point()`, `quad()`, `rect()`, `triangle()` – and basic color functions – `background()`, `colorMode()`, `fill()`, `noFill()`, `noStroke()`, `stroke()`. Remember to use createCanvas() to specify the dimensions of your canvas.

Post your entire folder on your creative server (it should include an index.html page, a script.js page, and a folder containing the p5 libraries). Submit the link on Edmodo.
