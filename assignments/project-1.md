title: Hypertext Narrative
permalink: /project-1/
---

Hypertext fiction is a genre of electronic literature, characterized by the use of hypertext links which provide a new context for non-linearity in literature and reader interaction. 

Choose a popular childrenâ€™s story, and without altering the text, redesign it as a non-linear narrative. Divide the story in multiple parts and place each part into a html page. Each page should have at 2-3 links to other segments. Infinite or Ending?

Project 1 is worth 10% of your grade.
