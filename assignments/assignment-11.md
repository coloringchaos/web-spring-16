# Personal Site Creative Brief

Create a simple .html page with the following content, in preparation for Project 6: 

1. **Written Brief**: Write a ~150 word creative brief for your [Personal Website](/web-spring-16/project-6) project. Your creative brief should describe both your creative interpretation of the project as well as the technical approach you will use. Also describe the content you plan to include.

2. **Visual Inspiration**: Submit at least 3 examples of websites that you find visually inspiring that will inform your design for Project 6. Consider things like content, button styling, colors, layout and interactivity. You should link to these pages and also take screenshots of these sites and post the images on your .html page. It is important that you see your examples of visual inspiration side by side. 
<br>*If you want to make something more extensive, you may also make a Pinterest page or other moodboard with a larger collection of visual examples.*

Post this page on your assignment portal and submit the link on Edmodo.
