#HTML Structure & Practice

1. Create a new .html page featuring an image gallery with at least six different images. Each should be contained within a `<figure>` element and also includes a `<figcaption>` element. Please include a `<h1>` at the top of the page with appropriate, related content.

2. Create a new .html page that includes two embedded Youtube videos, two embedded Vimeo videos, two embedded SoundCloud tracks, an embedded Google Map, an HTML5 `<video>` element in both mp4 and webm format, and an HTML5 `<audio>` element in both ogg and .mp3 format. Please include an `<h1>` at the top of the page with appropriate, related content.

3. Create a new .html page with a table and related data. Your table should have at least 4 rows and 4 columns. All content within the table should be the same theme or topic. No random content.

Once finished, upload all of these files onto your sever and create links to each one of them from your index.html assignment portal. Submit the links to your pages on Edmodo.
