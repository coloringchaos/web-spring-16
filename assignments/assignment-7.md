# CSS Media Query

Use a Mobile-First approach to build a simple web page that uses a css media query to detect when the browser is larger than 769px and adjusts the layout accordingly. You should use an external css stylesheet. The page can be simple, but it must be responsive.

You may reference the example we did in class, but you should build the page from scratch (with different class names, etc.).
