Create a simple interactive drawing experience using p5js. Your interactive page must include all of these:

+ One element controlled by the mouse.
+ One element that changes over time, independently of the mouse.
+ One element that is different every time you run the sketch.

Your challenge with this project is to create something engaging that the user would continue to use for more than a few seconds. Your project can be abstract, the important thing is that it is visually interesting and interactive.
