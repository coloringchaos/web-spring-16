#Site Map
1. Implement the file structure we went over in class on Monday, with all of your work inside a folder called 'web'. Within this web directory, there should be two directories called 'assignments' and 'projects'. So far, all of the work we have done this semester should live inside of 'assignments'. **Fix your file structure and update any broken links on your pages.**

2. Draw a sitemap of your file structure on the CU Creative Server. You may hand-draw or digitally generate the site map. Your map should include the files and directories that are on your server now, and should indicate how you plan to organize future projects. 

It is absolutely assential that you maintain clean file structure and organization throughout this class; this assignment is meant to help you better understand this site structure and gives you the chance to clean up your server.

Submit an image of your sitemap on Edmodo. I will also be checking your updated file structure.
