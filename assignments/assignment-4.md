#Site Map
1. Implement the file structure we went over in class on Monday, with all of your work inside a folder called 'web'. Within this web directory, there should be two directories called 'assignments' and 'projects'. So far, all of the work you have turned in should be in 'assignments'. **Fix your files structure, and update all the links on your pages if necessary.** 

2. Draw a sitemap of your file structure on the CU Creative Server. You may hand-draw or digitally generate the site map. Your map should include the files and directories that are on your server now, and should indicate how you plan to organize future projects. 

It is absolutely assential that you maintain clean file structure and organization throughout this class; this assignment is meant to help you better understand this site structure and gives you the chance to clean up your server.

Submit a photo of your sitemap on Edmodo. I will also be checking your file structure.
