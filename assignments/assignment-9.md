# Javascript Messages

Create a simple web page that has at least 3 hidden javascript messages (ie - the user should need to explore the page to find the messages). You must use an external javascript file. 

Explore using the following functions: 

`alert();`

`document.write();`

`console.log();`

As an additional challenge, try using the [HTML DOM innerHTML Property](http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/prop_html_innerhtml.asp).
