# Personal Site Wireframe & Colors

Add the following content to the bottom of the .html page that you built for [Assignment 11](/web-spring-16/assignment-11):

1. **Color Palette**: Determine a collection of 5 colors that you will use throughout the design of your page. I highly suggest using [Adobe's Color Tool](https://color.adobe.com/) for determining a *cohesive* palette. 

2. **Wireframes**: Use Photoshop to create to-scale wireframe designs of the pages you intend to build for Project 6.

Submit the link to your updated .html page on Edmodo. 

####  **Assignment 12 is due before class on APRIL 18th**
