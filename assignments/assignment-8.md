# Self Portrait Wireframe

1. Create a sketch (by hand) of what you intend to build for [Project 3](/web-spring-16/project-3). Next to your sketch, write down a list of media content and assets that you plan to use for this project (also indicate whether you have these assets already or if you need to make/acqurie them). Remember, your content for this project must be original!

2. Create a wireframe mockup of your idea for P3 using Photoshop. Use a grid to build your wireframe.

Create an .html page with both of your images (the sketch and the wireframe) and link to it from your assignment portal. Submit the link via Edmodo. 

####  **Assignment 8 is due before class on FEB 29th**
